- 6 or more simple functions and uses at least 5 of these in code 
- use input and output in two or more sophisticated ways in an application 
- two tests both test main features of the application and are highly relevant to checking that the application is running as expected 
- > 20 commits with meaningful commit messages 
- signifcant and highly frequent use of project management software to track development of app
